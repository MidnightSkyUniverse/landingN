                                    ol
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_1") Login locations and personal data entry points are protected at the transmission layer (SSL certificate). Thanks to this, personal data and login credentials entered on the site are encrypted on the user's computer and can only be read on the target server.
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_2") User passwords are stored in hashed form. The hashing function works one-way - it is impossible to reverse its operation, which is currently the modern standard for storing user passwords.
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_3") The Operator periodically changes its administrative passwords.
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_4") To minimize the risk of unauthorized access to data, the Operator uses complex passwords containing lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, no shorter than 8 characters.
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_5") Two-factor authentication is used on the website, which provides an additional form of protection for logging into the Website.
                                        li.mb-3(data-i18n="section2_6") An important element of data protection is regular updates of all software used by the Operator for processing personal data, which in particular means regular updates of programming components.
